Movie Recomendation System

Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the analysis of the TMDB movie dataset. The project involves the use of Python for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, utilizing visualization tools like Tableau for exploratory data analysis, generating queries in MySQL, and creating various machine learning models. Additionally, a recommendation system based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization and cosine similarity, has been implemented. The final application is built using the Streamlit framework.

Project Structure
Cleaning and Preprocessing: The Python script (cleaning_script.py) contains code for cleaning and preprocessing the TMDB movie dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Tableau was employed for EDA, and the visualization files (eda_visualizations.twb) are included.

MySQL Queries: The folder mysql_queries contains SQL queries used for extracting information from the dataset.

Machine Learning Models: The notebook (machine_learning_models.ipynb) showcases the creation and evaluation of different machine learning models.

NLP-based Recommendation System: The notebook (nlp_recommendation_system.ipynb) demonstrates the implementation of an NLP-based recommendation system using tokenization and cosine similarity.

Streamlit Application: The streamlit_app directory includes the code for the Streamlit application (app.py) that provides an interactive interface for users to explore movie recommendations.
